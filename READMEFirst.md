# PyCalc


Hi.., 

    Thanks for choosing our calculator. 
You need to use 2 pip frameworks  to use the calculator without making mistakes.
We have provided both of them as auto install (Works only in windows). If any case installing fails, You can use manual comments and can ignore if already have.

1) pip install simpleaudio.
2) pip install ttkthemes.

We have built the calculator to support
mouse entry and keyboard entry.Therefore the output can be taken very quickly by giving instructions through  keyboard.
